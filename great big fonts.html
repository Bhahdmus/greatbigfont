  <h1>Great Big Words</h1>
  <h2>by Michael Mark & Tom Chapin</h2>
  <p>
    When I was a little kid, a "<em class="big">diminutive juvenile</em>," 
    I liked my folks to read to me, I was an <em class="big">"eager bibliophile."</em> 
    Now I love words for how they sound 
    And how they <em class="big">"communicate."</em> 
    Perhaps I should explain myself, that is, <em class="big">"elucidate."</em> 
    Great big words, I like <em class="big">big</em> words. 
    Letter by letter, the <em class="bigger">bigger</em> the better 
    Great big words. La la la la la la la la la la!
